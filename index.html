        <h1>I went to a concert!</h1>

        <p>This was a concert that has been 10 years in the works for me.
            I first heard of Del Water Gap when I was in high school.
            I could have sworn that Lorenzo introduced me to his song High Tops.
            I was so sure of this that after the show I sent him a bunch of eager drunk texts explaining the iconic moment. To which he replied, "I hate to burst your bubble but I have never heard that song". My heart couldn't take it because I was and am still sure it was him.</p>
            <h1>Date Night</h1>

            <p>Kaitlyn and I decided to make a date night out of our evening in the city</p>
            <p>Kaitlyn was a doll and volunteered to drive us to the city. The party girl in me jumped at this because it mean't I could get drunky! Therefore, I pregamed with a flask of vodka. Not usually my drink of choice but it is what we had leftover from Galentines.
                We made it into the city, and parking was a nightmare. There was a moment where Kaitlyn was doing her stern voice leaning over the steering wheel and tipsy me knew to lock in. Eventually we found a suitable parking garage and set off to Lost Cat Bar and Bites.
                Thankfully, it wasn't crowded and we found a cozy booth. I wish I could remember the cocktails we ordered but they were yums! I brought a deck of cards with me and we kept ourselves entertained by playing speed and talking about Kaitlyns ex girlfriend Hannah. I know we talked about more but that part of the conversation is so clear in my drunken memory. I remember how fondly she spoke of Hannah and it made my heart warm. 
                After a few games, we had dinner, freshened up, and we were off to the show.
                Getting there was kinda funny because at this point, I am drunk. During our walk we laughed about the steepness of the hill. We also graciously (as gracious as you can be when you're drunk) walked into a liquor store to buy some shooters.</p>
            <h1>Oh My God</h1>
                <img src="dwg.jpeg" width="250" height="250"/>
                <p> I just love being a fangirl. It seems to be the only soically acceptable place for me to express my obsessive nature. The show itself was beautiful. Del Water Gap is one of the few artists I have seen live who sounds identical to their records. There is something so refreshing when live music holds the same quality as its digital counterparts. 
                    I danced the night away to my favorite songs. 
                    I noticed that not many people around me were in the groovy dancing vibe which is just crazy to me. Or maybe I was just drunk. 
                     It kinda felt like the entire room around me was still. Everyone is too uptight nowadays. I had a great time though.</p>
